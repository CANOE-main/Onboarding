Version 1 contains exercises that work on a previous version of canoe that does not require techoutputsplitaverage(TOSA), TOSA is not found in the activities or solutions

Version 2 contains exercises that work on the current version of canoe that does use TOSA and is implemented in the tables for both activities and solutions. 

The excercises are designed to aid in learning how the model works and how to implement changes within the canoe model.

Activity 1 is designed to create new technologies with specified techinputsplits and teaches you how different tables interact together

Activity 2 is designed to show how techgroups work and how to implement constraints using them

Activity 3 is a debugging activity with errors that are common in this space

Activity 4 demonstrates how to implement direct air capture into the model through the use of a dummy technology

Activity 5 (only in version 2) is an industry focused exercise that requires users to put a multi-input/output system into a model and get the model running
